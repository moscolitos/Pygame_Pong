# Python Pong Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Pygame library in Python. 

It features a single player mode with an AI opponent and supports three levels of difficulty: Easy, Medium, and Hard. The game also includes a score tracking system that increments a player's score each time the opponent fails to catch the ball.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* You have installed the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* You have installed the [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) library.

### Installing the Game

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/moscolitos/Pygame_Pong.git

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:

cd python-pong

3. Run the game:

## Using the Game

The game starts with a menu where you can select the difficulty level for the AI opponent. Use your mouse to click and select a level.

The game controls are:

* `Up Arrow`: Move paddle up.

The score is displayed at the top center of the screen. The game resets and increments the score for a player when the opponent fails to catch the ball.
